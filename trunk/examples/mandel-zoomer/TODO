* Extract should use the old palette (and maybe other stuff).
* Can use Save a Copy As to export.
* Add support for randomizing palettes.
* Might want Zoom By menu too.
* Should change the cursor to cross-hair.
* Add a random palette window:
	- average key colors field
	- interpolation method
		http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation
		or splines
	- interpolated palette
	- color wells below the palette showing key colors
	- grabbers extending from the wells into the palette
	- sentinel wells should not be draggable (so disable grabbers)
	- dragging outside the window should delete the key color
	- option drag should duplicate
	- don't show all the key colors if there are a lot?
* Temp palettes are cool.
* Might want duplicate command (duplicates the current doc).
* Probably need a quadatic to map dwells into the palette.
* Should be able to add and remove palettes.
* Should be able to copy image to the pasteboard. Selection too?
* Should build a fat gmp library.
* Normalized Iteration Count Algorithm looks interesting:
	- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set#Escape_time_algorithm
	- not sure its worth it once zoom in a bit tho
* Would be nice to show a remaining time estimate.
* Add a coordinate inspector:
	- hidden by default
	- shows point, pixel, dwell, palette location
* Need to call cascadeTopLeftFromPoint ourself for some reason.
* Should be able to use libgmp without requiring people to install it:
	- option 1 is to put the dylib in the bundle but then the native lib can't find it
	  (DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH doesn't seem to be exported to it)
	- option 2 is to have the native lib statically link and change the managed code
	  to p/invoke into the native lib for all the gmp calls
* Add an icon.
* Try packaging libgmp.3.5.0.dylib with the bundle (and be sure it works w/o gmp
   installed).
* Make sure windows and obejcts are going away.
* Might want to always save as xml and include an export as gif/png/etc option.
* Fracint uses gif extension blocks to save info.
* Add a menu to allow number of threads to be set.
* Might want to divide canvas into cells and randomly hand them off to the threads.
* Add support for adding and removing palettes:
	- can remove everything but the default palette?
	- add a make default command?
* Buddhabrot  looks cool, see
	- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set
* http://www.mrob.com/pub/muency/speedimprovements.html
* Run gendarme.
* Pref for initial size. Also startup action.
* Would be neat if doc info had a mini map showing location. Maybe with zoom in
   and out buttons.
* Anti-alias?
* Might want to add some styles:

	- min angle is kinda neat:
		double a1 = double.MaxValue;
		for (int i = 0; i + 1 < m_points.Count; ++i)
		{
			a1 = Math.Min(a1, (Math.PI/2 + Math.Atan((m_points[i + 1].Y - m_points[i].Y)/(m_points[i + 1].X - m_points[i].Y))));
		}
		return (float) a1;
	- maybe min velocity too:
		double v1 = double.MaxValue;
		for (int i = 0; i + 1 < m_points.Count; ++i)
		{
			v1 = Math.Min(v1, Math.Abs(m_points[i + 1].Magnitude - m_points[i].Magnitude));
		}
		return (float) v1;
* Can we use (or import) the Fractint file format?
* Optimizations:
