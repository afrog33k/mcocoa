-- Version 0.3.0.0 (r34) ----

* 85% of foundation methods and 77% of appkit methods now use a fast path
  which is between 5x and 7x faster than the old code.
* If a native argument is something like "int*" or "NSString**" the generated
  code will now use "out int" or "out string" instead of IntPtr.
* NSString.ToString returns null instead of string.Empty if the NSString is nil.
* Fixed some generated methods to return something more sensible than NSObject:
  localizedScannerWithString, scannerWithString, dictionary, dictionaryWithObject:forKey:, etc
* Added .NET style enumeration support to NSArray and NSDictionary.
* Fixed a bug in the typedef parser which caused the generator to think unichar
  was an unsigned int instead of an unsigned short.
* Use Trace.Assert instead of DBC.
* Improved the Natty example app:
     - The environment dialog now shows the default values (if any) set within the make file.
     - Added a Restore Defaults button to environment dialog.
     - Add some blank environment variables so users can add new ones that we couldn't pull out
       of the make file.
     - Current target, editor, ignored targets, and environment variables are saved in a pref.
     - Added a pref panel to allow editor and ignored targets to be set.
     - Natty comments in make files are no longer used.
     - When opening a file pop up an alert on failure instead of exiting the app.
     - Cleaned up the Makefile parser by using NSScanner.
     - Targets popup filters out a zillion internal targets generated by automake.
     - Can now clear the transcript window with command-K.

-- Version 0.2.0.0 (r20) ----

* Complete rewrite: instead of the experimental hand-coded wrappers
  we now generate wrappers based on Apple's headers.
* Methods which call directly into native code are now lower case.
