* Add some more automake targets:
	extra-bin zip-bin push
* Natty error:
	System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been thrown by the target of an Objective-C method call. ---> System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object

* Probably need to get rid of NSString.ToString, maybe can deprecate this first
* Might want NSString.Create that takes a format string.
* Window controllers should use the new ctor?
* Might want a white list for out arguments (can't tell from the headers if they
  are supposed to be arrays or not)
* Submit a bug for operator== hiding
* Need to handle NSError ** types.
* Work on Natty:
	- prefs could be used to save fonts, colors
	- need to support stdin (important for install or removing files
	  generated under sudo)
	- make files should default to RELEASE
	- would be nice to support nant
	- might be neat to have a lookup error command
* Probably should add interfaces for protocols.
* Release checklist:
	- search for TODO
	- run smoke
	- make sure unit tests work
	- make sure examples work in debug
	- make sure examples work in release
	- review tar target
	- make sure everything is checked in
	- use svn log -r 1:HEAD > CHANGE_LOG
	- update CHANGES file
	- update version number
	- remove build_num file 
	- install
	- update README and wiki
	- upload a new version to googlecode
	- send an announcement
	- make sure everything is checked in
