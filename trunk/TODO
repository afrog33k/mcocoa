NSURL is now the canonical way to refer to a file
bookmarks replace aliases (and support custom metadata)
might want to look into adding a helper for gcd, might need to add special code to support blocks
OpenCL (easy gpu programming)
Menlo font is a good monospaces font?

* Work on the quartz example:
	- add a pointer to the quartz example somewhere (maybe in the default Frameworks.xml
	  file too)
* Get rid of appkit CIColor and CIImage
* Use a static class for class category methods on interfaces not in the current framework.
* Need to checkin CGAffineTransform.cs.
* Might want to change generate to use peg-sharp.
* Add custom NSDictionary and NSMutableDictionary dictionaryWithObjectsAndKeys
	- might want to update quartz example too
* Stagger windows in examples.
* Might want to use standard install dir names. See
	http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/standards/Directory-Variables.html#Directory-Variables
* initWithIdentifier needs to return declaring type.
* Generate externs:
	- identify them all (name and file)
	- create a little native app to evaluate them
	- use the output of the native file to generate an Externs.cs file
	- add comments to identify the original file
* Get mandel-zoomer doing a bit better with gendarme.
* Would be nice to enable CLSCompliant. One problem is that a lot of cocoa
   methods use unsigned typed. Perhaps we can fix this by generating signed
   overloads and decorating the original versions with CLSCompliant.
* Might want a white list for out arguments (can't tell from the headers if they
  are supposed to be arrays or not, see NSBezierPath.getLineDashCountPhase)
* Work on Natty:
	- prefs could be used to save fonts, colors
	- need to support stdin (important for install or removing files
	  generated under sudo)
	- make files should default to RELEASE
	- would be nice to support nant
	- might be neat to have a lookup error command
* Probably should add interfaces for protocols.
* Release checklist:
	- search for TODO (everywhere)
	- run gendarme
	- make sure unit tests work
	- make sure examples work in debug
	- make sure examples work in release
	- review tar target
	- make sure everything is checked in
	- use svn log -r 1:HEAD > CHANGE_LOG
	- update CHANGES file
	- update version number
	- sync example version numbers with the lib
	- remove build_num file 
	- update libraries
	- install
	- upload new html docs
	- update README and wiki
	- delete the example bin directories
	- delete the generated code?
	- make distclean && make tar
	- upload a new version to googlecode
	- send an announcement
	- make sure everything is checked in
