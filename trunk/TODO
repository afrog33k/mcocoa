* Might want to get rid of the custom NSWindowController ctor. If not, then
   document it? Or mark it obsolete and add a comment.

* Might want to replace the Natty example with something more nifty.
* Would be nice to enable CLSCompliant. One problem is that a lot of cocoa
   methods use unsigned typed. Perhaps we can fix this by generating signed
   overloads and decorating the original versions with CLSCompliant.
* Might want a white list for out arguments (can't tell from the headers if they
  are supposed to be arrays or not, see NSBezierPath.getLineDashCountPhase)
* Work on Natty:
	- prefs could be used to save fonts, colors
	- need to support stdin (important for install or removing files
	  generated under sudo)
	- make files should default to RELEASE
	- would be nice to support nant
	- might be neat to have a lookup error command
* Probably should add interfaces for protocols.
* Release checklist:
	- search for TODO (everywhere)
	- run smoke
	- run gendarme
	- make sure unit tests work
	- make sure examples work in debug		NSTextStorage
	- make sure examples work in release
	- review tar target
	- make sure everything is checked in
	- use svn log -r 1:HEAD > CHANGE_LOG
	- update CHANGES file
	- update version number
	- remove build_num file 
	- update libraries
	- install
	- upload new html docs
	- update README and wiki
	- upload a new version to googlecode
	- send an announcement
	- make sure everything is checked in
