set a symbolic breakpoint at -[NSException raise]

* Check in generator?
* Might want to figure out all the methods an interface contains and then write them out:
	- so don't need extension classes
	- but we want to keep the file associations
	- would be nice to add a comment for classes generated for a category
	- how to handle class and instance methods with the same name? rename them both?
* Add a simple foundation unit test.
* Generated a method named fileURLWithPathIsDirectoryAVAILABLE_MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_4_AND_LATER
* See if natty works.
* Maybe we should generate string overloads for methods taking an NSString? Or just
  take an NSString?
* Update makefile for natty.
* Use tar --exclude \*/.svn --exclude \*/.svn/\*
* Generate partial classes:
	- probably want GetHashCode, Equals, ToString
* Remove the old google projects.
* Get rid of Ignore.
* Structs needs Equals and GetHashCode.
* Animatin views has a bad menu name.
* Add one or two more of Apple's sample apps.
* Probably should add interfaces for protocols.
* Menu handlers seem to work a bit differently than in objc. In objc exceptions
  seem to be logged, but in objc3-sharp the app terminates with an unhandled
  exception.
* Work on Natty:
	- order in transcript whenever its visible and we get new output
	- prefs could be used to save fonts, colors, editor, global vars
	- need to support stdin (important for install or removing files
	  generated under sudo)
	- make files should default to RELEASE
	- would be nice to support nant
	- might be neat to have a lookup error command
* Release checklist:
	- search for TODO
	- run smoke
	- make clean
	- make sure examples work in debug
	- make clean
	- make sure examples work in release
	- make clean
	- review tar target
	- make sure everything is checked in
	- use svn log -r 7:HEAD > CHANGE_LOG
	- update CHANGES file
	- update version and build numbers 
	- install
	- update README and wiki
	- upload a new version to googlecode
	- send an announcement
	- make sure everything is checked in
