BUILDING

You'll need to install the mobjc3 library which you can find at
<http://code.google.com/p/mobjc/>. Once you've done that navigate
to the mcocoa directory with a terminal and and type 'make generate' to
generate the wrapper classes. Then you can type 'make run-animating-views' 
to run the animating views example and 'make run-natty' to run the natty 
example (which is a gui wrapper for make files).

INSTALLING

To install type `sudo make install`, to uninstall type `sudo make uninstall`.

By default the libraries are installed into /usr/local/lib. You can 
change this with a command like this: `make INSTALL_DIR=/tmp install`.

Typically you'd copy the libraries out of /usr/local/lib into your
project's bin directory with a make target like this:

update-libraries:
	cp `pkg-config --variable=Libraries mobjc` bin
	cp `pkg-config --variable=Libraries mcocoa` bin
