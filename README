BUILDING

You'll need to install the objc3-sharp library which you can find at
<http://code.google.com/p/objc3-sharp/>. Once you've done that navigate
to the cocoa3-sharp directory with a terminal and and type 'make' to make 
the library and the example apps. Type 'make run-animating-views' to run
the animating views example and 'make run-natty' to run the natty example.

INSTALLING

To install type `sudo make install`, to uninstall type `sudo make uninstall`.

By default the libraries are installed into /usr/local/lib and
the cocoa-pack script is installed into /usr/local/bin. You can 
change this with a command like this: `make INSTALL_DIR=/tmp install`.
