* Might want to save env vars in a pref:
	- add ignored targets pref, default is install uninstall
	- get panel working with ignored targets 
	- need reset to restore defaults button
	- make sure other makefiles open ok
	- don't throw an exception if cant open file
* Update to new mobjc
	- get timing numbers (double iteration count)
	- update libraries
	- look at timing numbers again
	- check in mobjc and mcocoa
* See if caching selectors is a significant speed improvement.
* Why is NSText.string_ returning an NSString?
* Special case AutoreleasePool::Create (don't need to if we use CreateNative).
* May want to rewrite Create methods to use CreateNative. 
* See if we can get rid of the "alloc" special case in NSObject.Call
* Work on Natty:
	- prefs could be used to save fonts, colors, editor, global vars
	- need to support stdin (important for install or removing files
	  generated under sudo)
	- make files should default to RELEASE
	- would be nice to support nant
	- might be neat to have a lookup error command
* Probably should add interfaces for protocols.
* Release checklist:
	- search for TODO
	- run smoke
	- make sure unit tests work
	- make sure examples work in debug
	- make sure examples work in release
	- review tar target
	- make sure everything is checked in
	- use svn log -r 1:HEAD > CHANGE_LOG
	- update CHANGES file
	- update version and build numbers 
	- install
	- update README and wiki
	- upload a new version to googlecode
	- send an announcement
	- make sure everything is checked in
