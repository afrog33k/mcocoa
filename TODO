set a symbolic breakpoint at -[NSException raise]

* Add the new projects to google.
* Generate partial classes:
	- probably want GetHashCode, Equals, ToString
	- use xml or some simple file format to define the frameworks to process
	- print generate time, may want to compile regexen
	- need a black list for methods to be hand coded or skipped
	- skip NSObject.h
	- may want to be able to list methods that should be properties
	- how do we handle enums? Enums.NSUTF8StringEncoding? NSString.NSUTF8StringEncoding?
	- hand code functions?
* Remove the old google projects.
* Use tar --exclude \*/.svn --exclude \*/.svn/\*
* Make sure inner inner exceptions work.
* Get rid of Ignore.
* Structs needs Equals and GetHashCode.
* Add one or two more of Apple's sample apps.
* Probably should add interfaces for protocols.
* Menu handlers seem to work a bit differently than in objc. In objc exceptions
  seem to be logged, but in objc3-sharp the app terminates with an unhandled
  exception.
* Work on Natty:
	- order in transcript whenever its visible and we get new output
	- prefs could be used to save fonts, colors, editor, global vars
	- need to support stdin (important for install or removing files
	  generated under sudo)
	- make files should default to RELEASE
	- would be nice to support nant
	- might be neat to have a lookup error command
* Release checklist:
	- search for TODO
	- run smoke
	- make clean
	- make sure examples work in debug
	- make clean
	- make sure examples work in release
	- make clean
	- review tar target
	- make sure everything is checked in
	- use svn log -r 7:HEAD > CHANGE_LOG
	- update CHANGES file
	- update version and build numbers 
	- install
	- update README and wiki
	- upload a new version to googlecode
	- send an announcement
	- make sure everything is checked in
